Starter Kit for writing C and ASM on the LPC214x series, specifically the SparkFun UberBoard v2 on OS X 10.6.

You are expected to have:

* An UberBoard v2
** http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=555
* arm-none-eabi cross-compiler toolchain installed.
** http://github.com/stevej/summon-arm-toolchain contains a starter script for your Mac.
* A sense of adventure
** Child-like wonder will also work.

It all started with Sparkfun's "USB Bootloader
Tutorial":http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorial/USB_Bootloader/USB_Bootloader_UberBoard_Tutorial_Code.zip
which I modified to work with the ARM-GCC toolchain on Snow Leopard.
